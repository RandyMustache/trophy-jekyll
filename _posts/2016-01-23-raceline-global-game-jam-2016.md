## Global Game Jam 2016

From January 20th to January 22nd 2016 I participated in the Global Game Jam. Hosted here in Canberra at the AIE.

We were given 48 hours to make a game, based on a theme, which we would only learn about on the day. This years theme was ritual.

I participated with two friends [James](http://rensa.co/) and [Tom](https://github.com/tom-butler). While Tom and myself were graduated IT students, James was just a mere PHD candidate, or something. None of us had ever made a game before, and were excited by the opportunity and the challenge of making a fully playable game in 48 hours, while learning the ropes of game development in general.

Needless to say, we barely slept.

To start, we decided to develop our game in HTML5/Javascript, deciding it would be easier to do so. Despite the fact none of us had ever touched Javascript before in our lives. We used an existing game engine, of course, [Quintus](http://www.html5quintus.com). A fully open sourced HTML5 game engine. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/cykod/Quintus). It’s well featured, and well documented and proved an invaluable tool in our quest to create a game in 48 hours.

To get started we brainstormed ideas, and eventually settled on creating a racing game, thinking it would be easier (HAH!) than other genres. To fit in with the idea of a ritual, we decided we had to do something more than just your simple lap race format. For this we chose to incorperate the idea of your racer developing a line, your ritual, then to win, you have to follow your line (ritual) until you reach a certain amount of points. We had hoped to create multiple levels, and possibly even an AI, but time and experience got the best of us. In the end, we made one playable level, and a second, almost playable level.

Finally, we decided to have just a little bit of fun and hopefully generate a few laughs. The Game Jam had a few “Diversifier” options, one we picked for our game was title Loudmouth. To qualify, we had to make all game sounds with our own voice. Hilarity ensued.

 

In the end, a game was made, we had fun and learned a lot. We will look forward to doing it again.
