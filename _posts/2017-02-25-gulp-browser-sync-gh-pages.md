## Gulp and Browser Sync with Jekyll and GitHub Pages


![Browsersync](Browsersync.png)

I've now set this site up to live reload on my development machines with Browsersync and Gulp. It required very minimal work, and makes development so much easier.
Now I can write a post (like this one) on my local machine, watch changes as they happen, and upload only when I'm completely satisfied with the work.
Personally, I find this workflow much better.
